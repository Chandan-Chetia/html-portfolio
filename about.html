<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Chandan Chetia, a B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering. I’m passionate about coding, web development, and AI, and I’m currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C and C++. I also enjoy working on projects—right now, I’m exploring Arduino and building a physical calculator!

  My goal is to become a Software Engineer at Microsoft, and I’m actively improving my skills in web development to achieve it. Besides coding, I go to the gym daily to stay fit.
  
  I’m also interested in affiliate marketing as a side hustle during college. Feel free to connect with me if you share similar interests!
